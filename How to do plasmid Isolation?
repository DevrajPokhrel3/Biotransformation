Steps: - 
1. After culture, take out the tubes from shaking incubator and do centrifuge at 4°C at 3000rms machine for 10-15 minutes.
2. Throw out the supernant liquid from the tube and add 300µl solution I then vortex it to mix properly 
3. Then add 300µl solution II with shaking gently to get clear solution.
4. After that add 300µl solution III which gives precipitate and can be vortex for a while.
5. Transfer to new Eppendorf tube and do centrifuge for 10 minutes.
6 Then take only clear liquid in new Eppendorf tubes with well labelled. 
7. Now add 500µl resin after well shaking to Eppendorf tube where resin (positively charged) bind with DNA as DNA itself is negatively charged due to phosphate groups. 
8. Then run the vacuum filtration with well cleaned syringe and column in suspension motor. (Note: - syringe and column are cleaned with distilled water and chilled ethanol properly before using)
9. After that wash with chilled ethanol and do centrifuge for 5 mins to remove all ethanol in small centrifuge machine.
10. Now transfer the column in new well labelled Eppendorf tubes and add 30µl TE buffer in column and leave for 5-10minutes. 
11. And do the centrifugation for 3-5 minutes to collect isolated plasmid from resin.
12. Finally, required plasmid is isolated which can be used for the purpose and plasmid is stored in -20°C for a long time.

Further Plasmid is digested to get the size of vector and gene for the confirmation.
