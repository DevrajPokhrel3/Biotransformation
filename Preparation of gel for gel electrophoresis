Steps: -
1. After that weigh 0.8gm Agarose (E) for 100ml and mix with TAE Buffer to make total volume 100ml.
2. Then keep the solution in microvan for 2-3 minutes.
3. Now let the solution cool down and add 5 µl EtBR (Ethidium bromide) for 100ml.
4. Prepare the frame for electrophoresis by washing plate, comb and frame sheet with water then ethanol.
5. Pour the solution into the frame fitted with comb and wait for to freeze the gel for half an hour.
6. Load the 4-5 µl sample and marker of 1Kb after gel is ready and run for 30minutes.
7. Then take carefully ran gel into machine for analysis.

#Purification of Gene or vector
After running the gel-electrophoresis, the required band is cut in sterilized condition and chop it with knife and put inside new ET carefully then centrifuge for 2-3 mins before putting resin then shake well and keep the ET with gel in 37degree for 10-12 hrs to dissolve the gel completely but if it is urgent then heat the ET in 65degree water bath for 10-15minutes and run through the plasmid isolation vaccum to get the pure gene or vector by finally eluting with 15-20micro liter TE buffer or autoclaved distilled water.
