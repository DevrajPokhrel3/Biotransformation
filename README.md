# Biotransformation
It contains overall process of Biotranformation in Bacteria, I used in lab.

## How to do culture of E. coli?
Steps: - 
1. First of all, (switch on the power of Laminar Flow if not on) then clean and sterilize the Laminar Flow (Clean Bench) with ethanol.
2. Burn the lamp.
3. Put all the necessary materials inside the Bench.
4. Sterilize the hands with ethanol.
5. Well label the 15ml tubes clearly.

8. After that, carefully scratch the bacteria containing required genes from the plate with the help of autoclave tooth pin. 
9. Then insert the media and antibiotic containing respective tube with rubbing properly inside the solution.
10. Remove all the items which was used in LF Bench and switch on UV lamp after completing the work.
11. Close the cover properly and keep the tubes in 37°C shaking incubator for 5-6hrs until full growth of bacteria.

# How to do plasmid Isolation?
Steps: - 
1. After culture, take out the tubes from shaking incubator and do centrifuge at 4°C at 3000rms machine for 10-15 minutes.
2. Throw out the supernant liquid from the tube and add 300µl solution I then vortex it to mix properly

4. After that add 300µl solution III which gives precipitate and can be vortex for a while.
5. Transfer to new Eppendorf tube and do centrifuge for 10 minutes.
6 Then take only clear liquid in new Eppendorf tubes with well labelled. 
7. Now add 500µl resin after well shaking to Eppendorf tube where resin (positively charged) bind with DNA as DNA itself is negatively charged due to phosphate groups. 
8. Then run the vacuum filtration with well cleaned syringe and column in suspension motor. (Note: - syringe and column are cleaned with distilled water and chilled ethanol properly before using)
9. After that wash with chilled ethanol and do centrifuge for 5 mins to remove all ethanol in small centrifuge machine.
10. Now transfer the column in new well labelled Eppendorf tubes and add 30µl TE buffer in column and leave for 5-10minutes. 
11. And do the centrifugation for 3-5 minutes to collect isolated plasmid from resin.
12. Finally, required plasmid is isolated which can be used for the purpose and plasmid is stored in -20°C for a long time.

Further Plasmid is digested to get the size of vector and gene for the confirmation.

Total volume of mixture = 50µl
5.	All these are mixed in PCR tubes then centrifuge it for few minutes and keep in PCR machine after making proper program in PCR Machine. (By checking the appropriate melting temperature of the Primer form the detail slip).
Note; - always make 4 types of sample so that optimized conditions can be obtained.
6.	After the completion of the PCR run, check the band in gel electrophoresis. (just run 2µl)
7.	And do purification if normal gel electrophoresis is ok, make cutting gel and run with all the appropriate PCR product and cut the gel by cleaning the machine and knife with ethanol and cut required portion or part and make small pieces after separating other, then collect pices gel in new Eppendorf tube and add 1ml resin kept in 37°C incubator.

VIII.	Centrifuge and take the cells only. <br />
IX.	Add 300-400µl of 0.1M CaCl2 and re-suspend the cells to make ready competent cells of host (XL1 Blue) for ligation. <br />
X.	Then mix the DNA plasmid for 3-5’ and keep in ice. ( ligation mixture is 10-15µl in volume is ok, where plasmid is around 1-2 µl or sometime 3µl if concentration is low) <br />	
XI.	Give heat shock at 42°C for 50sec. <br />
XII.	Then keep in ice (2-3)’. <br />
XIII.	Add 300µl LB broth by pipette. <br />
